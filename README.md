**WHY?**
---
- Maternal health is a significant challenge in many parts of the world, with more than 800 women dying every day from preventable causes related to pregnancy. 
- India has the second-highest count of maternal mortality, with 35,000 maternal deaths in 2017.
- We chose this problem because we understand the importance of mothers, and women in general, which is undoubtedly utmost.
- Maternal mortality is highly unacceptable as it highlights inequalities in access to quality health services, and reflects the gap between rich and poor.

**Maternal Mortality Rate**
---
Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births due to pregnancy or termination of pregnancy, regardless of the site or duration of pregnancy. The maternal mortality rate is used to represent the risk associated with pregnancy among women.

**SOCIAL CHALLENGE**
---
- Factors that prevent women from receiving or seeking care during pregnancy and childbirth are health system failures that translate to poor quality of care, including disrespect, mistreatment and abuse. 
They also include social determinants, like income, access to education, race and ethnicity, that put some sub-populations at greater risk. 
- Harmful gender norms and/or inequalities result in a low prioritization of the rights of women and girls, including their right to safe, quality and affordable sexual and reproductive health services.
- According to the World Health Organization, one in five women in India suffer from mental health problems during pregnancy and after child birth.

**SOLUTION**
---
Bringing a new life into the world is an incredible experience, but it can also be overwhelming and stressful. 
To tackle this problem of maternal mortality, miscarriages, mental health of pregnant woman and unawareness we created  
**MaaMatters**
a web based application or a platform where we provide various services to the expectant mother both during and post pregnancy.

**OUR AIM**
---
- To support expecting mothers, we estimate their delivery dates and ensure that all necessary support is available when needed. 
- We also recognize the importance of blood supply during childbirth and make sure that enough blood is available in the required area to save lives.
- Our goal is to create a platform where pregnant women can find a safe space to communicate and connect with others who are facing similar issues.
